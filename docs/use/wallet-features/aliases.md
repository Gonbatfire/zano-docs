# Aliases

Each Zano user can register with an alias, for example, @easytouse, a human-readable name associated with a payment address and text comment stored in the blockchain. This alias provides a short, easy-to-remember name rather than a long, confusing string of random characters. Blockchain storage ensures that aliases are protected from being altered.

Each alias is assigned to a particular wallet. Only one alias can be created per wallet. To register an alias, select `Register an alias` from the wallet main window.

To reduce the possibility of phishing, we set limitations on alias registrations. Users can use any combination of the lower-case Latin letters a-z and the Arabic numerals 0-9. Additionally, the length must be a minimum of 6 characters and a maximum of 12.

:::note

Aliases shorter than 6 characters can only be issued by the Zano Core Team. Users can win one by participating in our monthly community events.

:::

The comment section will be temporarily stored in the blockchain until it passes a checkpoint. For more information on the pruning mechanism please refer to the [whitepaper](https://github.com/hyle-team/docs/blob/master/zano/Zano_WP_latest.pdf).

Aliases can be used for more than just Zano transactions. Think of them as a decentralised address book with universal IDs that can be used for various services based on the Zano platform.

:::note

You will be able to trade your aliases on a upcoming Alias Auction Platform.
