# Building with Zano

## Starting Your Development Journey

### RPC API Guide

Kickstart your journey with our RPC API Guide [Overview](rpc-api/overview.md). Here, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding from the Overview, and delve deeper into the specifics of [How to call the API](rpc-api/how-to-call-api.md). Whether your focus is on the [Daemon RPC API](rpc-api/daemon-rpc-api/get_alias_by_address.md) or the [Wallet RPC API](rpc-api/wallet-rpc-api/get_bulk_payments.md), our guide ensures clarity at every step.

### Confidential Assets

If launching your own project centered around private transactions is your goal, our [Confidential Assets](confidential-assets/overview.md) section provides detailed methods to give your initiative a solid foundation.

## Exchange Listing Guidelines

If you're looking to list your project or Zano assets on exchanges, it's crucial to follow specific guidelines to ensure compliance and success in your listings. We provide a [detailed set of guidelines](exchange-guidelines/multi-assets-custody-guide) that cover everything from technical requirements to compliance with financial regulations.
