# What is Zano

Zano is an open-source cryptocurrency (layer-1) and ecosystem with enterprise-grade privacy, security, and scalability that operates as a robust foundation for confidential assets and decentralized applications (dApps). In short, people can build all kinds of privacy-focused dApps on Zano utilizing our unique features such as Confidential Assets, Escrow Contracts, Aliases, and more.

On Zano everything is private by default, meaning people can’t see the amount transacted, the addresses involved, and not even the asset type transacted.

As illustrated in the image below, all you can see is that a transaction happened. The Confidential Assets (read user-creatable privacy tokens) enjoy the same level of privacy as native ZANO. Transactions are verifiable for the sender/receiver through transaction ID’s.
