# Staking Overview

Welcome to the Zano staking documentation! This section will guide you through everything you need to know about staking Zano and earning rewards through Proof-of-Stake mining.

## What is Staking?

Staking in Zano is a way to earn rewards by participating in the network's consensus mechanism. Unlike traditional Proof-of-Work mining that requires expensive hardware, staking allows you to earn rewards simply by keeping your Zano wallet running and connected to the network.

## Key Benefits

- **100% Anonymous**: Your staked balance remains hidden thanks to Zarcanum technology
- **No Lock-ups**: Unstake your coins at any time
- **No Minimum Amounts**: Stake any amount of ZANO
