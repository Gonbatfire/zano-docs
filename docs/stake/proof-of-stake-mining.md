# Staking Zano

Proof-of-stake mining or staking is typically implemented in such a way that a random coin owner obtains the right to sign a new block. Zano PoS implementation keeps miners in full anonymity and is as simple as a push of a button.

## Benefits of Zano Staking

- 100% Anonymous: Your staked balance always remains hidden thanks to our [Zarcanum Technology.](https://docs.zano.org/docs/learn/zano-features/overview#zarcanum-anonymous-proof-of-stake)

- No lock-ups: Unstake your coins at any chosen time.

- **EDIT** No minimum amounts: Stake as little as ?? $ZANO.

- Truly decentralized: Anyone can start staking. There are **no** validators or special nodes.

- No slashing.

- Easy-to-use: Simply flip the switch and start staking.

  The only requirement is to run a Zano node (At the moment, this can only be done on a desktop device).

  There is no "delegation" function in Zano Staking, as we believe that it goes against network decentralization, and running a Zano node takes very few resources.

## How to Stake Zano

```mdx-code-block
<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: 0 }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VruRhPSasPU"
    title="YouTube video player"
    style={{ 
    position: 'absolute', 
    top: 0, 
    left: 0, 
    width: '100%', 
    height: '100%' 
    }}
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  />
</div>
```

Open Zano app, make sure the blockchain is synchronised and turn on `Staking` switch.

You can observe your progress in the `Staking` tab of your staking wallet. The amount of earnings depends on the wallet balance. Note that funds, that participate in proof-of-stake will be locked. When you turn `Staking` off, balance will get unlocked right away. You can switch `Staking` on and off without any limitations.
